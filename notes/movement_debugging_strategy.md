# Character Movement Testing & Debugging Strategy

## Problem Analysis

Based on the research, the current implementation looks mostly correct, but there are several potential issues:

1. **API Usage**: The code correctly sets `controller.translation = Some(movement)` which is the right approach
2. **Movement Calculation**: Direction and distance calculations appear sound
3. **Potential Issues**:
   - Missing gravity simulation
   - Controller configuration might be incorrect
   - System ordering issues
   - Transform vs Controller synchronization problems

## Critical Findings from Research

### Key API Requirements:
- Must use `RigidBody::KinematicPositionBased` ✅ (current code uses this)
- Must set `controller.translation = Some(Vec3)` each frame ✅ (current code does this)
- Movement vector should be relative displacement, not absolute position ✅ (current code calculates this correctly)

### Common Issues:
- Characters getting stuck on walls when moving at angles
- System ordering: Systems reading `KinematicCharacterControllerOutput` must run BEFORE systems modifying `KinematicCharacterController`
- Missing gravity simulation (character controllers don't automatically handle gravity)

### Potential Root Causes:
1. **System Ordering**: The `update_player_from_controller_output` system might be interfering
2. **Missing Gravity**: Character might be "floating" and unable to move properly
3. **Controller Configuration**: Some settings might prevent movement
4. **Transform Synchronization**: Controller output might not be applying to Transform

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing Framework (No Game Runtime)

Create isolated tests for:
- Movement calculation logic
- Direction and distance computations
- Target acquisition and validation
- Controller configuration validation

### 2. Integration Testing Framework (Mock Bevy Systems)

Create test harnesses that:
- Mock Bevy's ECS systems
- Test system interactions
- Validate component state changes
- Verify system execution order

### 3. Runtime Debugging Tools

Implement comprehensive logging for:
- Input events (clicks, targets)
- Movement calculations
- Controller state changes
- Transform updates
- Physics state

### 4. Visual Debug Tools

Add debug rendering for:
- Target positions
- Movement vectors
- Character controller shape
- Ground contact points
- Collision shapes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Tests (Isolated Logic)
- Test movement calculation without Bevy
- Test direction/distance math
- Test controller configuration generation

### Phase 2: Mock Integration Tests
- Test system behavior with mocked components
- Verify state transitions
- Test edge cases

### Phase 3: Enhanced Runtime Debugging
- Add detailed logging to movement systems
- Add debug visualization
- Add performance monitoring

### Phase 4: Minimal Reference Implementation
- Create bare-bones working example
- Compare against current implementation
- Identify differences

### Phase 5: Systematic Debugging Protocol
- Step-by-step verification process
- Clear success/failure criteria
- Rollback strategies

## Next Steps

1. Create unit test framework for movement logic
2. Add comprehensive debug logging
3. Build minimal working example
4. Apply systematic debugging process
