# TUNING TIPS
# =============================================================================

# Want faster, more responsive movement?
# - Increase player_acceleration_force (try 1000-3000)
# - Increase player_rotation_torque (try 1000-3000)
# - Decrease player_stopping_distance (try 0.2-0.4)

# Want more challenging enemies?  
# - Increase enemy_speed_multiplier (try 0.9-1.2)
# - Increase enemy_acceleration_force (try 300-500)
# - Decrease enemy_stopping_distance (try 0.8-1.2)

# Want smoother, more realistic physics?
# - Decrease acceleration forces (try 100-200)
# - Increase stopping distances (try 1.0-2.0)
# - Increase slowdown distances (try 3.0-5.0)

# Want better performance with high-poly models?
# - Set max_lod_level = "medium" or "low" to cap maximum detail level for ALL characters
# - Decrease enemy_lod_distance_high (try 3.0-4.0) to use medium detail sooner
# - Decrease enemy_lod_distance_low (try 8.0-12.0) to use low detail sooner
# - Note: You need both player and enemy LOD files:
#   - players/hooded-high.glb, hooded-med.glb, hooded-low.glb
#   - enemies/dark-knight-high.glb, dark-knight-med.glb, dark-knight-low.glb
